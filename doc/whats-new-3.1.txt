The following is a list of noteworthy changes between ircd-ratbox 3.0
and ircd-ratbox-3.1.

Installation
------------
 o The name of the executable that is generated is now ircd-ratbox 
   instead of ircd.  Any crontabs should be updated to reflect this change.  
   Also you should remove any old executables in the $PREFIX/bin directory
   named ircd, the install process will not do this for you.
 o Nicklen is now a runtime configurable option(up to 30 characters)
   Nicklens beyond 30 will need a recompile as before.
 o Minimum nickname length is settable as well with serverinfo::nicklen_min
 

Config
------
 o Built in DNS RBL support via the blacklist {} configuration option
 o Add ipv6_tun_remap option. This remap transitional IPv6 technologies(teredo,
   6to4) to their IPv4 addresses for the purpose of channel bans and klines
 o Add options to configure TLS versions and ECDH support as well. 
 o WHOWAS history length can now be set at runtime with the whowas_length
   option
 o CERTFP support for connect {}, operator {} and auth{}.  CERTFP acts as an
   additional gate to these blocks and does not replace password/challenge.

Misc
----
 o Improve memory usage reporting
 o The code is much more reliant on C99 features, gcc 4.x and clang have
   been tested.  Let us know if another compiler does not compile it.
 o Fix time_t issues on 32bit OpenBSD with 64bit time_t
 o General code cleanups, dead code removal
 o REHASH memory leaks are gone! 
 o Add ELIST new ELIST features C and T
