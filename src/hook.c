 * ircd-ratbox: an advanced Internet Relay Chat Daemon(ircd).
 * hook.c - code for dealing with the hook system
 *
 * This code is basically a slow leaking array.	 Events are simply just a
 * position in this array.  When hooks are added, events will be created if
 * they dont exist - this means modules with hooks can be loaded in any
 * order, and events are preserved through module reloads.
