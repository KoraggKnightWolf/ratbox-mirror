RESV [time] <channel|nick> :<reason>

Reserves a channel or nickname from use.  If [time] is not specified this 
is added to resv.conf, otherwise is temporary for [time] minutes.

Nick resvs accept the same wildcard chars as xlines.
Channel resvs only use exact string comparisons.

RESV [time] <channel|nick> ON <server> :<reason>

Will attempt to set the RESV on <server> if <server> accepts remote RESVs.

Administrators can also add a locked RESV with the following syntax:

RESV <channel|nick> lock :[reason]

A locked RESV can only be removed by an administrator.
