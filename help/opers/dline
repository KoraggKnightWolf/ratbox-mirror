DLINE [duration] <ip> :[reason] [| oper reason]

Adds a DLINE to the database which will deny any
connections from the IP address of the banned client.
The banned client will receive a message saying
he/she is banned with reason [reason].

Duration is optional, and is in minutes. If specified,
the DLINE will not be saved to the database.

If an oper reason is added (the pipe must be specified
to separate the fields), this will be added into the
database but will not be shown to the user when they
are given the dline reason.

Administrators can also add a DLINE that can only be removed by
other administrators with the ADMINDLINE command.

- Requires Oper Priv: K
